# Step 1
Clone this folder to your computer. You can do this by cd-ing into a directory of choice, and then running
```git clone --recursive git@github.com:mickn/epm_video.git```

# Step 2
Go to the newly created folder
```cd ./epm_video```

# Step 3
In 'Terminal' run: ```export PATH=~/anaconda2/bin:$PATH```

# Step 4
In 'Terminal' run ```ipython --pylab```

# Step 5
Now run ```%run 01-setzones.py``` 
This should bring up a screen where you can add the 8 points to the video.
